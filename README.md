# Shellacc
The "Shell  Accoutrements" I use on all of my computers

## What's included

This is an eclectic set of commands, settings, and configurations that I use on my personal computers.  Most of what's included is my own creations, including many trivial helpers, and many scripts that took nontrivial work but didn't warrant publication as a separate project.  Some of what's included is copied or adapted from various sources throughout the internet, and I've attempted to link to sources wherever possible.

## Installation

Once implemented, you'll be able to "equip" almost any bash shell using this command:

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Polyergic/Shellacc/master/bin/equip -# -f | bash

Someday you'll be able to selectively apply the settings and configurations you want to adopt.
